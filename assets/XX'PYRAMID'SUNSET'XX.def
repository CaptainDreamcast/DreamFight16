; Definition of KFM's stage
; *** denotes values you should change/check for each stage.
; The term "background" is used to mean both backgrounds and foregrounds.

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Info]
 ;Name of the stage.
name = "XX'Pyramid'Sunset'XX"

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Camera]
 ;Camera starting position: Usually 0 for both
startx = 0
starty = 0
boundleft = -160
boundright = 160
boundhigh = -200
verticalfollow = .75
floortension = 40
tension = 60
boundlow = 0

;--------------------------------------------------------
[PlayerInfo]
;--- Player 1 ---
 ;Player 1 starting coordinates.
 ;p1startx is typically -70 and p2startx is 70.
 ;p1starty and p1startz should be 0.
p1startx = -70          ;Starting x coordinates
p1starty = 0            ;Starting y coordinates
p1startz = 0            ;Starting z coordinates
p1facing = 1            ;Direction player faces: 1=right, -1=left

;--- Player 2 ---
p2startx = 70
p2starty = 0
p2startz = 0
p2facing = -1

;--- Common ---
 ;Don't change these values.
leftbound  = -1000 ;Left bound (x-movement)
rightbound =  1000 ;Right bound
topbound  =  0     ;Top bound (z-movement)
botbound  =  0     ;Bottom bound

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Scaling]
 ;No need to change these values
topz     = 0       ;Top z-coordinate for scaling
botz     = 50      ;Bottom z-coordinate for scaling
topscale = 1       ;Scale to use at top
botscale = 1.2     ;Scale to use at bottom

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Bound]
 ;Distance from left/right edge of screen that player can move to
 ;Typically 15
screenleft = 20    ;Dist from left of screen that player can move to
screenright = 20   ;Right edge

;--------------------------------------------------------
[StageInfo]
 ;Z offset for drawing
 ;Adjust this value to move the ground level up/down in the screen.
 ;It's the position where the players stand at.
 ;Up - smaller, Down - larger
 ;***
zoffset = 215

 ;Leave this at 1. It makes the players face each other
autoturn = 1

 ;Set the following to 1 to have the background be reset between
 ;rounds.
resetBG = 1
HIres = 1

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Shadow]
 ;This controls the darkness of the shadow. Valid values range
 ;from 0 (lightest) to 256 (darkest). Defaults to 128 if omitted.
intensity = 64

 ;This is the shadow color given in r,g,b. Valid values for each
 ;range from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest).
 ;Defaults to 0,0,0 if omitted.
 ;intensity and color's effects add up to give the final shadow
 ;result.
color = 0,0,0

 ;This is the scale factor of the shadow. Use a big scale factor
 ;to make the shadow longer. You can use a NEGATIVE scale factor
 ;to make the shadow fall INTO the screen.
 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = -.1

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the
 ;ground. If omitted, defaults to no level effects (shadow is
 ;always fully visible).
fade.range = -400,-100

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Reflection]
 ;Intensity of reflection (from 0 to 256). Set to 0 to have no
 ;reflection. Defaults to 0.
intensity = 0

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Music]
 ;Put a filename for a MOD, MP3 or MIDI here, or just leave it
 ;blank if you don't want music. If an invalid filename is
 ;given, then no music will play. To play CD audio, put
 ;the track number followed by ".da". Using a track number of
 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da
bgmusic = sound\Avdol.mp3

 ;Adjust the volume. 0 is normal, negative for softer, and
 ;positive for louder (only for mp3, mods and CDA)
bgvolume = 255
