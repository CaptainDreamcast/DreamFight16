-----------------------------------------------------------
Why I made this?

I did not have mugen for a for a short, and when I redownloaded it, I downloaded my characters along with it.
I then fought my "old" Sonic several times, and i ALWAYS lost to him. Plus I decided that he has bad animation.
I told myself that I could do way better, and this is what I've been creating over the past 2 months.

What's new

-New Attacks
This Sonic is completely different from the first one I've made. It's attacks are sort of
based on the Sonic from Super Smash Brothers:Brawl.


-5 specials

Homing Attack = Down, Forward, (any kick)

Ring Toss = Down, Forward, (any punch)

Spin Dash = Down, Backward, (any punch)

Foot Storm = Any kick button in rapid succesion (3 times)

Spring Jump = Down, Up (Or just press Up while crouching)


-2 Hypers,
Super Sonic = Down, Forward, any two punches

and Dark Super Sonic = Down, Down, (any punch)
 Note: During the Dark Super Sonic Special, there is a new catch. It does not require any power, but instead takes away life
force. Make sure you hit!(Use at own risk...) 


-7 colors (i'll add more when I update......)
Original
8-bit
Black
Inverted Palette
Mephiles the Dark
Scourge the hedgehog
Metal Sonic
-Attacks can be comboed from weakest to stongest.
-2 different voicepacks(Special Thanks to Marshtomp8)

Ryan Drummond or Jason Griffith
